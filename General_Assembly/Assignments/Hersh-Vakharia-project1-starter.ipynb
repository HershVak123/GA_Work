Then, we multiple the IQR by 1.5 and multiply our Q1 and Q3 values by the resulting product. The values we get from this will be our \"inner fences\" for the data. We can determine outliers by which values lie beyond these inner fence values. If we want to determine whether the outlier is a major outlier, we instead multiply our Q1 and Q3 values by 3 * IQR to get our \"outer fence\" values. A major outlier will lie outside these outer fence values."
